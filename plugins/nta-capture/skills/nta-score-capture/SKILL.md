description: >-
  Maximizes legitimate PDPM NTA (Non-Therapy Ancillary) comorbidity capture by
  parsing hospital referral/discharge documentation for the ~50 CMS-published
  NTA conditions and services, producing an evidence-backed capture worksheet
  with point totals, tier, and a documentation-request list. Also audits a
  completed MDS against the packet to find missed points. Use whenever the user
  mentions NTA, non-therapy ancillary, comorbidity capture, missed NTA points,
  PDPM component scoring, or MDS Section I/O/K/M coding for reimbursement — or
  asks to review a hospital packet, H&P, med list, or discharge summary for
  conditions that affect SNF payment.

# NTA Score Capture

Help SNF MDS coordinators, billers, and admissions staff find every
**legitimately documented** NTA comorbidity in a hospital packet before the
5-day MDS locks in the score. Accuracy in both directions: never miss a
documented condition, and never suggest coding one that isn't clinically
supported.

## Why NTA matters

- Under PDPM, the NTA component is the one most often **under-captured**. It
  depends on scattered comorbidity evidence (med lists, labs, wound notes,
  infection notes) rather than a single assessment section, so points slip
  through when nobody reads the whole packet.
- NTA is paid with a **variable per diem adjustment: 3x the NTA rate on days
  1–3** of the stay, then 1.0x for days 4–100. Missing points hurts most in
  the highest-cost first days.
- Each condition adds points; the **point total maps to a tier** (NF through
  NA), and the tier's case-mix index multiplies the NTA base rate for the
  **entire stay**. One missed 1-point condition can drop the whole stay a tier.
- The capture window is short: most NTA items come from the 5-day PDPM
  assessment (and the SNF claim, for HIV/AIDS), so the review has to happen at
  or immediately after admission.

**Ethics — read this first.** The goal is accurate capture of REAL, documented
conditions — never upcoding. Suggesting a diagnosis that is not in the medical
record, or coding a condition a physician has not documented as active, is
miscoding. Miscoding exposes the facility to MAC/UPIC audits, repayment
demands, and **False Claims Act liability**. Every candidate you surface must
carry a direct quote from the source document, and anything ambiguous goes in
the "needs confirmation" bucket, not the score.

## Reference

Read [references/nta-conditions.md](references/nta-conditions.md) for the full
CMS-published NTA comorbidity list with point values and MDS item sources.
That list reflects the PDPM NTA table as publicly published; item numbers and
mappings **must be verified against the current MDS RAI manual and the current
fiscal year's SNF PPS final rule** before use.

## Workflow: packet capture (default mode)

### Step 1 — Inventory the packet

Identify what documents you have: H&P, discharge summary, medication list /
MAR, labs, wound care notes, respiratory/therapy notes, infection control or
isolation notes, nutrition notes, operative reports. Note what is **missing**
(e.g., no med list, no recent labs) — missing documents become items on the
"documentation to request" list.

### Step 2 — Hunt where NTA conditions hide

Go source-by-source. NTA conditions rarely announce themselves; they hide in
predictable places:

| Where to look | What to find |
|---|---|
| **Medication list / MAR** | IV medications (any route = IV/IM push or infusion while a resident → O0110 IV meds, 5 pts); insulin **plus** the diabetes diagnosis it supports; immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, cyclosporine) that reveal an undocumented **transplant status**; chemo agents; antiretrovirals suggesting HIV (claim-coded) |
| **Labs** | eGFR/creatinine trends supporting CKD staging and related I8000 diagnoses; albumin/prealbumin supporting malnutrition workup (dx still required); cultures confirming MDRO or C. diff |
| **H&P / problem list / discharge dx** | HIV/AIDS, COPD/asthma/chronic lung disease, diabetes, morbid obesity (BMI + dx), malnutrition, multiple sclerosis, IBD, lupus/connective tissue disease, epilepsy, cirrhosis/end-stage liver disease, heart/lung/kidney transplant history |
| **Wound documentation** | Stage 4 pressure ulcer, diabetic foot ulcer, other foot infection/open lesion, wound infection, severe burns; ostomy presence |
| **Infusion / IV therapy records** | IV fluids or IV meds given, dates relative to admission; parenteral nutrition (TPN/PPN) and the proportion of intake it supplies (high vs. low intensity) |
| **Respiratory notes** | Ventilator/respirator use, tracheostomy care, suctioning, oxygen at admission (supports chronic lung disease coding context) |
| **Infection / isolation notes** | MDRO (MRSA, VRE, CRE, ESBL), single-room isolation for active infection, C. difficile, history of septicemia, wound infections, opportunistic infections |
| **Nutrition notes** | Feeding tube, parenteral/IV feeding, malnutrition dx from a dietitian assessment (needs physician documentation to code I5600) |

Match every hit against the reference list. Cast a wide net here — filtering
happens in Step 3.

### Step 3 — Build the candidate table with evidence

For each candidate condition record:

1. **Evidence quote** — the exact sentence/line from the packet, with document
   and date. No quote, no candidate.
2. **MDS source item** — where it would be coded: Section I active diagnoses
   (I1300–I8000), Section O special treatments (O0110), Section K nutritional
   approaches (K0520 / intake proportions), Section M skin (M0300, M1040),
   Section H appliances (H0100), or the **SNF claim** (HIV/AIDS via ICD-10
   B20 — not an MDS item). Section GG does not feed NTA but note function
   items if the packet supports them.
3. **Status** — `Documented` (clear, active, physician-documented, meets the
   MDS lookback/active-diagnosis rules) or `Needs confirmation` (mentioned but
   ambiguous: "history of" without active management, dietitian-only
   malnutrition note, resolved infection, med without matching dx).

Apply the RAI "active diagnosis" discipline: a Section I diagnosis must be
physician-documented (or by an authorized licensed practitioner) in the
lookback and have a direct relationship to current status — a stale problem
list entry alone is not enough. Say so explicitly when that is the gap.

### Step 4 — Score and tier

Sum points for **Documented** items only. Report two totals: confirmed, and
potential (confirmed + needs-confirmation). Map to the tier:

| NTA points | Tier |
|---|---|
| 12+ | NA |
| 9–11 | NB |
| 6–8 | NC |
| 3–5 | ND |
| 1–2 | NE |
| 0 | NF |

If a needs-confirmation item would change the tier, flag it prominently —
that is where a documentation request has direct payment impact. Do not quote
dollar amounts; tell the user to apply the current FY final rule's NTA
case-mix indexes and rates.

### Step 5 — Documentation to request

List concrete asks, each tied to a candidate: e.g., "Physician documentation
that malnutrition is an active diagnosis (dietitian note dated X supports it)",
"Clarify transplant history implied by tacrolimus on the med list", "Confirm
IV medication administration dates fall within the MDS lookback".

## Workflow: missed-points audit mode

When given a completed MDS coding summary **plus** the packet:

1. Run Steps 1–3 above on the packet independently — do not anchor on what
   was coded.
2. Diff your candidate table against the MDS: conditions documented in the
   packet but **not captured** on the MDS are the findings.
3. For each miss, state the evidence quote, the MDS item it belongs on, and
   the point value. Also flag the reverse: anything **coded on the MDS with no
   supporting evidence in the packet** is an audit risk and should be verified
   against the full record.
4. Note whether a modification/correction of the assessment is worth pursuing
   per RAI correction policy (the user decides with their RN Assessment
   Coordinator; do not assert it is permissible for their specific case).
5. Use the same output format, adding a `Coded on MDS?` column.

## Output format

Produce exactly this structure:

```markdown
# NTA Capture Worksheet — [Patient A / identifier provided] — [date]

Documents reviewed: [list]
Documents missing: [list or "none noted"]

## Candidate conditions

| Condition (NTA list name) | Points | Evidence (quoted, source + date) | MDS source item | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diabetes Mellitus | 2 | "A1c 8.2; continue insulin glargine" — Discharge summary, 6/1 | I2900 | Documented |
| Malnutrition | 1 | "moderate protein-calorie malnutrition per RD" — Nutrition note, 5/30 | I5600 | Needs confirmation — requires physician documentation |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Score

- Confirmed NTA points: [n] → Tier [NF/NE/ND/NC/NB/NA]
- Potential with confirmations: [n] → Tier [x]
- Tier-changing items: [list or "none"]

## Documentation to request

1. [Specific ask, tied to condition + evidence]
2. ...

## Notes

- [Lookback-window cautions, ambiguities, audit-risk flags]
- Verify all point values, item numbers, and case-mix indexes against the
  current MDS RAI manual and the current FY SNF PPS final rule.
```

In audit mode, add a `Coded on MDS?` column and a "## Missed points" section
summarizing the delta (points and tier before/after).

## Disclaimer

This skill is educational. All MDS coding must be supported by the medical
record and clinician judgment; never code conditions that are not clinically
documented. Point values, item numbers, tier thresholds, and case-mix indexes
change — verify everything against the current MDS RAI manual and the current
fiscal year CMS SNF PPS final rule. This is not billing, coding, or legal
advice.
