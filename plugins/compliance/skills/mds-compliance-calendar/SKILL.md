  Builds and audits a skilled nursing facility's MDS assessment and regulatory
  reporting calendar: PPS 5-day and IPA windows, the OBRA schedule (admission,
  quarterly, annual, significant change), discharge assessments, PBJ quarterly
  submission deadlines, and how staffing data feeds Five-Star. Use whenever a
  user mentions MDS scheduling, ARDs, assessment windows, late or missed
  assessments, default rate risk, PBJ deadlines, or asks "what assessments are
  due" for a resident, a census list, or a date range. Also use proactively when
  a user shares a resident census with admission dates or a list of completed
  assessments and wants to know whether the facility is compliant.

# MDS Compliance Calendar

Build a dated, per-resident assessment schedule from a facility census, and
audit past assessments for missed or late items. The goal is simple: no
assessment should ever surprise the MDS coordinator, because every deadline is
on a calendar with lead time before it hits.

**Why this matters.** MDS timing errors are expensive in three distinct ways:
a late PPS assessment forces billing at the **default rate** (the lowest
payment) for non-covered days; late OBRA assessments are survey citations
(assessment F-tags); and late or failed PBJ submissions can suppress the
facility's Five-Star staffing rating. All three are preventable with a
calendar built from admission dates.

**Currency rule.** Assessment windows, item sets, and PBJ deadlines drift
across RAI manual versions and CMS memos. Treat every rule below as the
publicly known baseline and always tell the user to **verify against the
current MDS 3.0 RAI Manual (Chapter 2 for scheduling) and current CMS PBJ
policy memos** before acting. State-specific assessment requirements (e.g.,
state Medicaid case-mix OBRA rules) are out of scope here — flag them as a
verification item, do not guess.

## Core scheduling rules (public baseline — verify current RAI manual)

### PPS assessments (Medicare Part A stays, PDPM)

- **5-Day assessment**: required for every Medicare Part A stay. ARD
  (Assessment Reference Date) must be set on **days 1–8** of the Part A stay.
  Under PDPM it establishes the payment classification for the entire stay
  unless an IPA is completed.
- **Interim Payment Assessment (IPA)**: **optional**. Complete when the
  facility determines a resident's clinical condition has changed enough that
  the PDPM classification should change. The ARD is any day the facility
  chooses; payment changes from the ARD forward. Because it is optional, put
  it on the calendar as a *clinical trigger review*, not a fixed date.
- **Late 5-Day consequence**: if the ARD is set after day 8, the facility
  bills the **default rate** for the days of the stay not covered by a timely
  assessment. Never present a late 5-Day as merely a paperwork problem — it
  is a direct revenue loss.

### OBRA assessments (all residents regardless of payer)

- **Admission (comprehensive)**: must be **completed by day 14** of the stay
  (admission date = day 1). Includes CAAs and feeds the baseline/comprehensive
  care plan.
- **Quarterly**: ARD no later than **92 days after the ARD of the previous
  OBRA assessment**.
- **Annual (comprehensive)**: ARD no later than **366 days after the ARD of
  the most recent comprehensive assessment** (and still within 92 days of the
  last OBRA assessment of any type).
- **Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA)**: comprehensive
  assessment completed within **14 days of determining** a significant change
  (improvement or decline) has occurred. An SCSA resets the annual/quarterly
  clock like any comprehensive.
- **Significant correction assessments** (SCPA/SCQA) exist for correcting a
  prior comprehensive/quarterly; mention them in audits when a correction
  pattern appears.

### Discharge and tracking

- **Discharge assessments** (return anticipated / return not anticipated):
  ARD = date of discharge; complete within 14 days.
- **Death in facility** tracking record when a resident dies in the facility.
- **Part A PPS Discharge assessment** when a Medicare Part A stay ends but the
  resident remains in the facility (may be combined with an OBRA discharge
  when the resident physically leaves).

### PPS/OBRA interaction for Medicare stays

For a new Medicare admission, the 5-Day window (days 1–8) sits inside the
OBRA admission window (by day 14). Facilities may **combine** assessments
when the windows overlap and the item set supports it — the combined ARD must
satisfy **both** schedules' rules (use the more restrictive window). When
building a calendar, propose combined assessments where legal because they
reduce workload, but show both underlying deadlines so a slipped ARD is
caught against the tighter one.

### Submission timing

Completed MDS records must be encoded and submitted to CMS (iQIES) on the
RAI-manual timelines (baseline: encode within 7 days of completion, submit
within 14 days of completion). Include submission due dates on the calendar,
not just ARDs — a perfect ARD with a late submission is still non-compliant.

## PBJ (Payroll-Based Journal)

Staffing data is submitted quarterly for **federal fiscal quarters**, due
**45 days after quarter end**. Baseline deadlines (**verify current CMS
dates** — they shift when the 45th day lands on a weekend/holiday and CMS
occasionally grants extensions):

| Fiscal quarter | Period covered | Baseline due date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Oct 1 – Dec 31 | **Feb 14** |
| Q2 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 | **May 15** |
| Q3 | Apr 1 – Jun 30 | **Aug 14** |
| Q4 | Jul 1 – Sep 30 | **Nov 14** |

Put an internal deadline **2+ weeks before** each CMS date on the calendar so
payroll reconciliation and census-day verification happen before submission,
not after a rejection.

## Five-Star connection (why the calendar includes PBJ)

Care Compare's Five-Star rating has three domains: **health inspections**
(survey results), **staffing** (computed from PBJ hours vs. MDS/census-based
resident acuity), and **quality measures** (largely MDS-derived). A missed or
failed PBJ submission, or an audit failure, results in a suppressed or
one-star staffing rating for the quarter. MDS accuracy also flows directly
into QMs. This is why an "assessment calendar" must carry PBJ dates too: the
same rating is damaged by either miss.

## Workflow

### Mode A — Build a forward calendar

1. **Collect inputs**: for each resident — name/identifier, admission date,
   payer (Medicare Part A vs. other), most recent OBRA ARD and type, most
   recent comprehensive ARD, any pending significant-change determinations,
   expected discharge if known. Also today's date and the calendar horizon
   (default: 90 days). Never ask for or retain more resident detail than
   scheduling needs; identifiers/initials are enough — this tool must not
   become a PHI store.
2. **Compute deadlines** per resident using the rules above: 5-Day window end
   (day 8), OBRA admission completion (day 14), next quarterly (prior OBRA
   ARD + 92), next annual (last comprehensive ARD + 366), plus submission due
   dates. Show the arithmetic (e.g., "admitted 3/2 → day 8 = 3/9") so the
   coordinator can verify day-counting; day 1 = admission date.
3. **Propose combinations** where PPS and OBRA windows overlap, using the
   most restrictive window.
4. **Add facility-level items**: the next PBJ due date and a recommended
   internal PBJ deadline.
5. **Flag risk**: mark any deadline within 7 days as AT RISK, any already
   passed without a completed assessment as OVERDUE, and state the concrete
   consequence (default rate / citation exposure / staffing-star impact).
6. **Output** using the format below, sorted by due date.

### Mode B — Audit past assessments

1. **Collect inputs**: per resident, the list of completed assessments (type,
   ARD, completion date, submission date if known) plus admission date and
   payer for the period audited.
2. **Check each interval**: 5-Day ARD within days 1–8; admission completed by
   day 14; each OBRA ARD ≤ 92 days after the prior; comprehensive ≤ 366 days;
   discharge assessments present for each discharge; submissions within
   timelines where dates are available.
3. **Classify findings**: `Late` (done outside window), `Missed` (never
   done), `Gap` (interval exceeded between assessments), `Unverifiable`
   (missing data — say exactly what is missing rather than assuming
   compliance).
4. **Quantify impact** where possible: for late/missed 5-Days, list the days
   exposed to default-rate billing; for OBRA misses, note citation exposure.
5. **Output** the same calendar table for the audited period plus a findings
   list, and recommend the fix (e.g., complete now and submit; consult the
   current RAI manual's late-assessment instructions for whether/how to
   complete an out-of-window assessment).

## Output format

Produce exactly this structure:

```markdown
# MDS Compliance Calendar — [Facility] — generated [date]
Horizon: [start] to [end] | Residents reviewed: [n]
Rules baseline: MDS 3.0 RAI Manual (VERIFY current version) + CMS PBJ memos

## Assessment schedule
| Due date | Resident | Assessment | Window / rule | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-09 | R. Smith | PPS 5-Day (ARD by day 8) | Days 1–8; admitted 2026-03-02 | AT RISK | Combine with OBRA Admission if ARD set by 3/9 |
| 2026-03-15 | R. Smith | OBRA Admission (complete) | By day 14 | ON TRACK | CAAs + care plan due same date |
| 2026-05-15 | FACILITY | PBJ Q2 submission | FY quarter + 45 days | ON TRACK | Internal deadline 2026-05-01 |

Status values: ON TRACK / AT RISK (≤7 days) / OVERDUE / DONE / UNVERIFIABLE

## Risk flags
1. [OVERDUE] [Resident] — [assessment] due [date]: [consequence — e.g.,
   default rate applies to days X–Y; estimated exposure; action to take now]
2. [AT RISK] ...

## Audit findings (Mode B only)
| Resident | Assessment | Required by | Actual | Finding | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Verify before acting
- Current RAI manual version and any scheduling changes: [items to check]
- Current PBJ deadline for [quarter]: [baseline date] — confirm on CMS PBJ page
- State-specific OBRA/case-mix requirements for [state]: not evaluated here
```

Keep the table sorted by due date, facility-level rows (PBJ) interleaved by
date, and every OVERDUE/AT RISK row echoed in the Risk flags section with its
consequence spelled out — the flags section is what an administrator will
actually read.
